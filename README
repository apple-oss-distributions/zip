This is the "zip" repository, which contains the zip(1) and unzip(1)
commands originally developed by the Info-Zip project.  The canonical
home page for these tools are:

Zip: <http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html>
UnZip: <http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html>

The final releases of both packages were:

Zip 3.0 (released 5 June 2008)
UnZip 6.0 (released 20 April 2009)
